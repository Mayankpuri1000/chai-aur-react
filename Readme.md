Test file for react setup

## Older Installation
```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```
but it takes a lot of time to install all the dependencies and setup the project. So, we can use the following command to install the dependencies and setup the project in one go.

## New Installation
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
